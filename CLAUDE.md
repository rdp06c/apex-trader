# APEX – Scorecard-Guided Manual Trading Dashboard

APEX is a single-page trading dashboard that screens ~1020 stocks across 14 sectors, scores them with a composite scoring engine, and surfaces actionable signals via a candidate scorecard. The user makes all buy/sell decisions manually, guided by the scorecard and trade insights. Uses Massive (formerly Polygon.io) for market data. No framework. No cash/budget concept — portfolio return is based on cost basis of invested capital.

├── GET/POST /api/portfolio     ← Server-side portfolio storage (JSON file)
├── GET /api/scanner/status     ← Scanner health check
├── GET /admin                  ← Admin panel (status, logs, actions)

├── Cloudflare Tunnel           ← Remote access (trycloudflare.com URL)
├── Auto-pull (cron)            ← Pulls from GitHub main every 5 min
└── Basic auth                  ← Password protection via .env

├── portfolioStorage adapter    ← Server-first with localStorage fallback
├── Massive API                 ← Market data (snapshots, bars, details, etc.)

├── Google Drive API            ← Optional backup/restore
└── localStorage                ← Market data caches, API keys
```

**Key design**: The `portfolioStorage` adapter auto-detects whether a server is available. If no server (e.g., opened as a local file), it falls back to localStorage. Dashboard works in both modes with zero config.

## Deployment

**Pi deployment** (primary):
1. Clone repo, `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in `MASSIVE_API_KEY`, `NTFY_TOPIC`, `AUTH_USER`, `AUTH_PASS`
3. `npm start` — serves on port 4000
4. Systemd services: `apex.service` (server), `apex-tunnel.service` (Cloudflare tunnel)
5. Cron: `auto-pull.sh` runs every 5 min, pulls from `main`, rebuilds and restarts if source files changed

**Remote access**: Cloudflare named tunnel at `https://dash.arc-apex.com`. Configured via `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` on Pi. Basic auth protects all routes.

**Update workflow**: Push to `main` on GitHub → Pi auto-pulls within 5 min → rebuilds → restarts → ntfy notification confirms. Or use "Pull & Restart" button on admin panel for immediate update.

## Core Workflow

1. **Scan Market** — fetches prices, ~65-day OHLCV bars, ticker details, short interest, server indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA50), VIX for ~1020 stocks across 14 sectors. Populates all caches. Server indicators fetched for ALL stocks (no cap). Auto-refreshes UI (holding cards, portfolio metrics) on completion — no manual "Refresh Prices" needed.
2. **Score** — `calculateCompositeScore` produces weighted sum of core components (momentum ×0.3, RS ×0.6, structure ×1.25, RSI, MACD, sector flow, SMA, volume) + calibration combo heat bonus (±6.0 max, from hot/cold combos). Noise components zeroed (accel, consistency, FVG). Pullback mega-bonus removed (was +5 and 1.15× multiplier). Then `computeSignalBonus` adds a calibration-driven bonus for stocks matching entry signal patterns (GREEN full match gets full bonus scaled by edge ×1.5, capped at 10.0; YELLOW gets 35%). Calibration-backed sources (heat + signal) contribute ~43% of max score.
3. **Candidate Scorecard** — expanded by default. Full universe displayed with sortable, color-coded columns: Sig (entry signal badge), Heat (combo heat dots), Score, Price, Day%, 5D, MOM, VOL, RS, RSI, MACD, Structure, DTC, Sector, MCap. All columns sortable (click header to toggle asc/desc). Setup filter dropdown (All Setups / Any Signal / REV / MOM / QMO / SQZ / LDR / AVOID). Sector filter dropdown. Paginated (40 per page).
4. **Manual Trade** — user enters buy/sell via modal. Same-day trades auto-capture all live signals from caches (run Scan Market first for richest data).
5. **Trade Insights** — derived rules, performance summary, signal accuracy table, signal combinations (from calibration), regime history — all computed from `closedTrades` and calibration data

## Manual Trade System

All trades are entered manually via the Manual Trade modal (`openManualTradeModal`, `submitManualTrade`).

**Buy path:**
- Fetches ~65-day historical bars for the entry date
- Reconstructs signals via `reconstructSignals()`: RSI, MACD, SMA, structure, momentum, 5D return, volume trend
- Enriches with live cache data: RS, sector rotation, DTC, market cap, composite score, VIX, volume ratio, news sentiment, price vs VWAP
- Records transaction with full `entryTechnicals`, creates `holdingTheses` entry
- **Tip:** Run Scan Market before entering buys to populate all caches for maximum signal capture

**Sell path:**
- Gets `getCurrentPositionBuys()` BEFORE pushing sell transaction (critical ordering)
- Computes P&L, return%, hold time from matched buy transactions
- Auto-classifies exit reason (profit_target, stop_loss, catalyst_failure, manual)
- Captures `exitTechnicals` from `lastCandidateScores`: RSI, MACD, structure, composite score, momentum, RS, volume trend, sector flow, VIX
- Preserves `healthHistory` from `holdingTheses` into `closedTrade.exitTechnicals.healthHistory` before thesis deletion
- Pushes to `closedTrades` for Trade Insights and Journal analytics

**Undo Last Trade** (`undoLastTrade`):
- Appears after any manual buy/sell, disappears on page reload or Scan Market
- Reverses cash, holdings, closedTrades, holdingTheses changes
- Confirms before executing

## Key Subsystems

**Composite Scoring** (`calculateCompositeScore`): Core components (momentum ×0.3, RS ×0.6, structure ×1.25, RSI, MACD, sector flow, SMA, volume, extension/runner penalties) plus calibration combo heat bonus (`comboHeatBonus` param, ±6.0 max). Noise components zeroed (accel, consistency, FVG — uncorrelated per calibration). Pullback bonus removed (was +5 AND 1.15× multiplier — the biggest score distorter). Weights in `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`, calibratable. `getActiveWeights()` selects regime-aware weights (VIX < 20 vs ≥ 20). Returns `{total, breakdown}` for tooltip decomposition. After scoring, `computeSignalBonus()` adds a bonus for stocks matching calibrated entry signal patterns (GREEN = edge × 1.5 capped at 10.0, YELLOW = 35%). `computeComboHeatBonus()` converts hot/cold combos into the heat bonus (0.5 pts per % edge, ±2.0 per combo). Calibration-backed sources (heat + signal) are ~43% of max score.

**Market Structure** (`detectStructure`): ICT/SMC analysis — swing highs/lows, CHoCH, BOS, liquidity sweeps, FVGs on ~65-day bars. Only takes `symbol` param, reads from `multiDayCache[symbol]`.

**Calibration Engine** (`runCalibrationSweep`): Sweeps 80 historical dates, runs full pipeline, correlates scoring components with forward returns, derives calibrated weights with shrinkage. Regime-segmented. Out-of-sample validated. Chat command: `calibrate`. Also runs signal combo analysis (`analyzeSignalCombos`) — tests 18 curated signal combinations against historical observations to discover which combos predict positive/negative 10-day forward returns vs baseline.

**Entry Signals & VIX-Zone Routing**: Signal gating is VIX-zone based (FORGE-validated, March 2026):
- VIX 20+: REV signals only qualify for BUY/ADD/NEAR
- VIX 15-20: MOM and LDR signals qualify; REV only if full quality (all 3 criteria met)
- VIX < 15: MOM full quality only
- Override checkbox in scorecard header to see all signals regardless of VIX zone
- `ENTRY_SIGNAL_PATTERNS` + `evaluateEntrySignals()` — 6 data-driven patterns: REV (reversal), MOM (momentum continuation), QMO (quiet momentum), SQZ (squeeze), LDR (sector leader), AVOID (exhausted runner anti-pattern). GREEN = all criteria met, YELLOW = one miss, GRAY = minimum met, RED = avoid. `computeSignalBonus()` bridges signals into the score. **REV is the strongest signal (+19pp edge, 55.9% WR on 18K+ trades). MOM is preferred in calm markets (VIX < 20).**
- `SIGNAL_COMBO_DEFS` + `evaluateComboHeat()` — tests each stock's current signals against 18 combos, cross-references calibration results to show green dots (hot combos) and red dots (cold combos) in the Heat column. **Heat now directly affects the composite score** via `computeComboHeatBonus()` — hot combos add up to +2.0 each, cold combos subtract up to -2.0 each, net capped at ±6.0. Heat dots filtered by setup type via `SETUP_HEAT_GROUPS`. Requires calibration data to function.
- Score driver badge (S/M) indicates whether a stock's score is signal-driven or momentum-driven.

**Holdings Health**: Holdings cards show a compact inline stat line (MOM, RS, RSI with mini SVG sparklines showing trajectory, plus MACD, Structure, DTC, CHoCH, Vol, Stop/Target levels) and a footer row (Entry, Cost, Now, S/R, News count with tooltip). Sell/profit signals display as a centered badge in the card header. Cards are sortable by Date Added, Total P&L%, Daily Change%, Position Size, or Health (with ascending/descending toggle). Custom themed dropdown replaces native `<select>` for dark mode compatibility.

**Risk Dashboard** (`updateRiskDashboard`): Simplified Target 10 view of all holdings. Columns: Symbol, Sig (entry signal badge), Price, P&L%, Stop (−10% from avg cost), Target (+10% from avg cost), Days (held, yellow if < 3-day minimum). Risk levels based on P&L%: danger (≤ −8%), caution (≤ −5%), healthy (> −5%). Sorted by risk level then P&L ascending.

**Health History Tracking**: Daily health snapshots per holding stored in `holdingTheses[symbol].healthHistory[]`. Seeded at buy time from entry data + caches. Updated daily by server full scan (RS, momentum, RSI, MACD, structure, compositeScore, price). Deduped by date, capped at 120 entries. Powers sparklines on holdings cards and health-over-time charts in journal detail view. Preserved into `closedTrade.exitTechnicals.healthHistory` on sell.

**Trade Insights** (`updateLearningInsightsDisplay`): Renders in the Trade Insights section (collapsed by default). Shows:
- Trading rules derived from `deriveTradingRules()` — patterns that work/don't work
- Performance summary — W/L record, avg win/loss, profit factor, recent trend
- Signal accuracy table — win rate and avg return by signal condition (momentum, RS, RSI, MACD, structure, DTC, VIX, etc.)
- Signal combinations — hot/cold combo tables from calibration backtesting with "Show all" toggle
- Regime history — current regime, transitions, near-transition win rate

**Trade History** (`updateTradeHistory`): Table of all closed trades sorted most-recent-first. Shows symbol, buy/sell dates, shares, P&L, return%, hold time.

**Chat Interface** (`sendMessage`): Conversational with portfolio context. Gated behind activation button. Special commands: `calibrate`, `backtest YYYY-MM-DD`. Uses Cloudflare Worker proxy to Claude API.

**Google Drive**: OAuth 2.0 backup/restore. Optional — Pi server is the primary storage now.

## Analytics Page (`analytics.html`)

Standalone page with 20+ Chart.js visualizations of closed trade data. Global filter bar: date presets (All/30D/90D/YTD), custom date range, outcome (All/Wins/Losses), sector dropdown, symbol search. Filters work by swapping `data.closedTrades` with a filtered subset before `renderAll()` — zero changes needed in individual render functions. Key sections: **Win Rate by VIX Zone** (FORGE playbook validation), **Win Rate by ATR%** (R:R replacement), **Exit Rule Compliance** (+10%/-10% adherence), return distribution, cumulative P&L, drawdown, streaks, win rate by sector/month/hold time, entry signal accuracy, "Did I Sell Too Early?" (5D post-exit tracking).

## Journal Page (`journal.html`)

Standalone trade journal with transaction log and closed trades table. Filters: symbol search, outcome (win/loss), sector. Trade detail modal opens on row click — shows trade header (symbol, dates, P&L, exit badge), entry conditions grid, exit conditions grid, health-over-time Chart.js line chart (RS, Momentum×10, RSI from healthHistory), entry/exit reasoning notes, and post-exit price tracking.

## Background Scanner

Runs on the Pi via `server/scanner/monitor.js`. Two modes:

### Structure Monitor
Checks structure on all held positions every 15 minutes during market hours. Can also be triggered manually from the admin panel (bypasses market hours check).

**Alert conditions:**
- Entry structure was bullish, current is bearish → "Structure Breakdown"
- Bearish CHoCH detected → "Bearish CHoCH"
- Price below stop price (if set in holding thesis) → "Stop Loss Breached"
- Bearish volume divergence detected → "Volume Divergence"
**Trade plan integration**: Scanner computes `generateTradePlan()` per holding using bars and structure already fetched. Fixed +10% target / -10% stop (FORGE-validated). Stored in `scanner-state.json` readings as `tradePlan` (ATR metrics, stop, target, support, resistance). Client falls back to scanner trade plan when local bars unavailable.

**Loss signals** (computed per holding, displayed on admin panel): ATR stop, bearish CHoCH, bearish structure, thesis stop breached, RS collapse (>30pt drop), momentum collapse (entry 7+ → now <3), structure flip, volume divergence.

**Deduplication:** Same condition for same symbol won't re-alert within 4 hours.

### Full Market Scan
Runs the complete scoring pipeline on all ~1020 stocks server-side. Scheduled at **9:35 AM ET** (5 min after open) and **12:30 PM ET** (midday update). Can also be triggered from the admin panel via "Run Full Scan" button.

**Pipeline:** Fetches bulk snapshots, ~65-day grouped daily bars (80 API calls), server indicators (RSI/MACD/SMA50), ticker details, short interest, VIX → computes momentum, RS, structure, sector rotation, composite score for every stock → saves results to `portfolio.json` as `lastCandidateScores`.

**Browser integration:** The browser's Candidate Scorecard automatically picks up server scan results on next portfolio load. A "server scan" tag appears in the scorecard header when displaying server-generated data. Manual browser scans still work independently and override the server data.

**Resource impact:** ~21 grouped daily bar API calls + ~1020×3 indicator calls + ~1020 ticker detail calls. Takes 5-10 minutes on the Pi. Sends ntfy notification with top 5 scorers on completion.

**Alert delivery:** POST to ntfy.sh topic (configured via `NTFY_TOPIC` in `.env`).

### Extracted Server Functions
Stock universe in `server/lib/stocks.js` (stockNames, stockSectors, getAllSymbols). When adding/removing stocks, update BOTH `server/lib/stocks.js` and `src/trader.js`.

Scoring in `server/lib/scoring.js`: all pure scoring functions adapted to accept data as params. Fetching in `server/lib/fetchers.js`: all Massive API wrappers for Node.js. Duplication with client accepted because client runs in a `<script>` tag and cannot import Node modules.

## Admin Panel

Available at `/admin` (linked from dashboard header nav). Shows:
- Server uptime, market status, last scanner run, last full scan, total alerts sent, stocks scored
- Top scorers from last full scan (symbol, score, price)
- Scanner readings for each holding (price, structure, RSI, MACD, ATR color-coded, CHoCH, loss signal count with warnings)
- Action buttons: "Pull & Restart" (triggers auto-pull.sh), "Run Scanner Now" (structure check), "Run Full Scan" (~540 stock scan)
- Log viewers: server logs (journalctl), auto-pull logs

## Portfolio Storage

**Primary:** `server/data/portfolio.json` on Pi. Read/written via `/api/portfolio` endpoints. Atomic writes (tmp file + rename). Last 5 saves kept as timestamped backups in `server/data/backups/`.

**Fallback:** localStorage in browser (`aiTradingPortfolio` key). Always written as backup alongside server saves.

**Restore:** `POST /api/portfolio/restore/:filename` restores from a backup. Google Drive restore still works from the browser.

**`portfolioStorage` adapter** (in `src/trader.js`): Probes `/api/portfolio` on first load. If server responds, uses server for all reads/writes. If not (e.g., opened as local file), falls back to localStorage. Browser always saves to both.

## Design Constraints

**Single HTML Output**: Build produces one `index.html` — intentional for portability. Source split across `src/` for development.

**After-Hours Pricing**: `isMarketOpen()` checks ET timezone. When market is closed, price priority is `day.c > lastTrade.p`; when open, `lastTrade.p > day.c`. Change calculations recomputed from scratch when closed (Polygon's pre-computed values include extended-hours movement).

**XSS Prevention**: All user content escaped via `escapeHtml()` before `innerHTML` insertion.

**Massive API**: Stocks Advanced + Indices Basic plan — unlimited calls (recommended <100 req/s). Caching is for performance, not rate limits.

**Bulk Snapshot Cache**: `fetchBulkSnapshot()` uses a 15-second cache. Cache hit requires ALL requested symbols present (`symbols.every`), and new fetches merge via `Object.assign` (not overwrite).

**Basic Auth**: Configured via `AUTH_USER` and `AUTH_PASS` in `.env`. Protects all routes (dashboard, API, admin). Disabled if not set.

## Portfolio Metrics

**Total Return** = Realized P&L (sum of closedTrades.profitLoss) + Unrealized P&L (current holdings value − cost basis). Percentage based on current cost basis. No cash/budget concept — `portfolio.cash` is legacy.

**Alpha vs SPY** = Total Return % − SPY return % (from `spyBaseline` price). Same realized + unrealized formula.

**Cost Basis**: Computed via `getCurrentPositionBuys()` which tracks buys for the current position (after any full exit/re-entry).

## Portfolio State

Persisted to Pi server (with localStorage fallback). Key fields: `holdings`, `transactions`, `closedTrades`, `holdingTheses`, `performanceHistory`, `lastMarketRegime`, `lastCandidateScores`, `lastSectorRotation`, `lastVIX`, `regimeHistory`, `portfolioHealth`. Array caps on save: transactions (500), closedTrades (300), performanceHistory (3000).

## Known Issues

- **Technical indicators dual source**: Client-side RSI/MACD are approximations from ~65-day bars. Server values (`serverRsi`, `serverMacd`, `serverSma50`) use full history and are fetched for all stocks during Scan Market. Client for scoring, server for display.
- **Keyboard accessibility**: Collapsible sections use `<div onclick>` — should migrate to `<button>` with proper roles
- **FVG detection partial**: Detected and scored (±0.5) but not used in reversal filtering
- **RS not reconstructable**: Relative strength requires full market context at time of entry. For historical manual trades, RS is null unless cached from a prior Scan Market.
- **Tunnel**: Permanent domain `dash.arc-apex.com` via Cloudflare named tunnel. No URL changes on reboot.

## Legacy AI Code

The codebase still contains the two-phase AI analysis system (`runAIAnalysis`, Phase 1/Phase 2 prompts, `executeSingleTrade`, `executeMultipleTrades`, budget/risk controls). This code is not actively used — the "Run AI Analysis" button has been removed. The chat interface still uses the Cloudflare Worker proxy for conversational queries.

## Stock Universe

~1020 stocks across 14 sectors: Technology (183), Consumer (159), Industrials (129), Financial (126), Healthcare (110), Energy (90), Materials (77), Real Estate (71), Defense (32), Automotive (23), Crypto (12), Space (8), Index Fund (4). Full S&P 500 coverage plus quality mid-caps. **Four** lists must stay in sync when adding/removing stocks:
1. `stockNames` in `src/trader.js` — display names
2. `stockSectors` in `src/trader.js` — sector classification
3. `screenStocks()` in `src/trader.js` — scan list (sector-grouped arrays, deduplicated)
4. `server/lib/stocks.js` — server-side mirror (stockNames, stockSectors, getAllSymbols)

Coverage includes: full S&P 500, AI/software, semiconductors, cybersecurity, biotech/genomics, digital health, EV/auto, fintech/payments, crypto-adjacent, space/satellite, drones/eVTOL, infrastructure/data center, materials/mining, defense contractors, REITs, consumer staples, utilities, insurance, asset managers, and quality mid-caps across all sectors.

## Development Notes

- Edit `src/`, rebuild with `bash build.sh`. **Never edit `index.html` directly.**
- Test with "Scan Market" button (fetches market data and updates scorecard without AI)
- `let`/`const` throughout, `async/await` throughout
- Extensive console logging
- Push to `main` → Pi auto-pulls within 5 min, or use admin panel "Pull & Restart"
- Server files in `server/` — these run on the Pi only, not in the browser
- Scoring functions duplicated between `src/trader.js` (browser) and `server/lib/scoring.js` (Node.js) — keep in sync. Includes `evaluateEntrySignals`, `ENTRY_SIGNAL_PATTERNS`, `computeSignalBonus`, `computeComboHeatBonus`, and `generateTradePlan`.
- Stock lists duplicated between `src/trader.js` and `server/lib/stocks.js` — keep in sync

## FORGE Playbook Integration (March 2026)

FORGE backtesting (44,487 trades, 2018-2026) validated a trading playbook now integrated into APEX:

**Exit rules:** Fixed +10% take profit / -10% cut loss / 3-day minimum hold. Replaces ATR-based targets.

**VIX-zone signal routing:**
- VIX 25+: REV signals, ATR 3%+ of price, RSI 25-40, RS 20-60
- VIX 20-25: REV signals, ATR < 2% of price, RS 40+, shallow dips
- VIX 15-20: MOM signals, ATR < 3%, momentum 5-6, RS 50-70
- VIX < 15: MOM full quality only, ATR < 2%, Defense/Real Estate only

**RSI cap:** RSI < 25 bonus reduced to 2.0 (from 4.0). Deep oversold underperforms RSI 25-40 in every VIX zone.

**ATR replaces R:R:** "Target in ATRs" = (price × 10%) / ATR. Color-coded by VIX zone — low ATRs green in fear (easy bounce), high ATRs green in calm (steady grind).

**Never buy:** Automotive sector (<50% WR), RSI < 25, REV in VIX < 15, MOM with momentum 8+, ATR 5%+ in calm markets.

**Playbook reference:** Available at `/playbook` (linked in dashboard nav). Source: `playbook.html`.

**Calibration:** Don't run APEX's old calibration sweep. Re-run FORGE backtests every 6 months to validate playbook. Weights are locked to FORGE-validated values.

## Scorecard Column Highlighting

Color thresholds for scorecard cells (green = favorable for entry, yellow = caution, red = danger):

| Column | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| MOM | 5–7.5 | 7.5–9 | 9+ |
| RS | 60–85 | 85–95 | 95+ |
| RSI | <40 (<30 = oversold) | — | >70 (>80 = overbought) |
| 5D | -2% to -8% (pullback) | >8% | <-8% |
| VOL | High mom + high vol, or low mom + high vol | — | High mom + low vol (divergence) |
| MACD | Bullish cross | — | Bearish cross |
| Structure | Bullish | — | Bearish |
| DTC | — | >3 (elevated) | — |
| DTC (accent) | >5 (squeeze) | — | — |
| Score | ≥12 | ≥8 | <4 |
